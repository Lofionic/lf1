		<h3 id="c1">Chapter 1 &mdash; Introduction</h3>
		<p>The LF1 Monosynth is an analogue-modelling vintage styled single-voice synthesizer. It features two oscillators, one low frequency oscillator (LFO), a resonant voltage controlled filter (VCF), envelopes for amplitude and filter, and an on-screen keyboard with glide, glissando and pitchbend controls.</p>
		<p>As a monosynth, the LF1 is fundamentally restricted to playing one note at a time. Because of this, monosynths inherently lend themselves primarily to bass and lead parts. However, with creative use of the oscillator and LFO parameters, or by using external tools, more varied and rich soundscapes can be produced.</p>
		<h3 id="c2">Chapter 2 &mdash; The Synth Components</h3>
		<p>The LF1's architecture is based on the classic subtractive synthesis model. Several independent components interact with one another to craft the synth's audio output. By fine tuning the parameters of each component, a vast range of sounds can be reproduced.</p>
		<h4>2.1 Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO)</h4>
		<p>The two oscillators produce the raw signal which forms the basis of LF1's sound, by generating waveforms at a frequency controlled by the 'voltage' of the input device (usually a keyboard). The LF1's oscillators have the following parameters:</p>
		<p><strong>A: Octave</strong><br/>
		This is the base octave of the tone generated by the oscillator. They range from 16' (lowest) to 2' (highest).</p>
		<p><strong>B: Waveform</strong><br/>
		The waveform generated by the oscillator effects the overall timbre of the tone. Available choices are sine wave (pure and sweet), saw wave (buzzy and harsh) and square wave (piercing and reedy). By blending oscillators of different waveforms together, entirely new timbres can be produced.</p>
		<p><strong>C: Level</strong><br/>
		This controls the relative level of each oscillator. Turning both controls towards the higher values will lead to a natural overdrive.</p>
		<p><strong>D: Frequency Adjust (Oscillator 2 only)</strong><br/> 
		The second oscillator can be adjusted within +/- 7 semitones of the base frequency. This can be used to create rich harmonic intervals or discordant phasing effects.</p>
		<h4>2.2 Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF)</h4>
		<p>The filter is used to control the range of frequencies allowed through from the oscillators, and is a powerful tool for shaping the overall timbre of the sound.</p> 
		<p><strong>A: Cutoff</strong><br/>
		The LF1 filter is a low-pass filter, meaning it will allow frequencies that are lower than its cutoff. At its lowest point, almost all frequencies are filtered, meaning the output signal will be next to nothing. As the cutoff is raised, the filter opens and higher frequencies will be allowed through. With the cutoff in its maximum position, the filter will not remove any audible frequencies.</p>
		<p><strong>B: Resonance</strong><br/>
		Resonance controls the peak in amplitude at the cutoff frequency. At low values, there will be no resonance. At high values, a frequency spike will noticeably affect the timbre of the audio signal. When resonance is set to full, self-oscillation will occur and the filter will begin to generate a tone of its own.</p>
		<p><strong>C: EG Amount</strong><br/>
		This controls the magnitude of the effect that the filter envelope will have on the filter's cutoff. When set to zero, the filter envelope will have no effect. When adjusted to a positive value, the envelope will effect the filter in a typical manner. At full, the envelope will control the cutoff across the full range from zero to the level set by the cutoff control.  When turned to negative values, the envelope will be inverted, and will have a negative effect on the cutoff level. See 2.3 Envelopes for more detail.</p>
		<h4>2.3 Envelopes</h4>
		<p>The LF1 has two envelopes, which control the overall amplitude of the signal, and the cutoff of the filter, respectively. They allow you to shape the sound over time, and react to release of the key. These types of envelopes are known as ASDR (Attack, Sustain, Decay, Release) envelopes, in respect to the parameters they use to control their effect:</p>
		<p><strong>A: Attack</strong><br/>
		This is how quickly the envelope takes affect after the key is first triggered. High values will produce a natural 'swell', short values will produce an instantaneous hit.</p>
		<p><strong>B: Decay</strong><br/>
		This controls how quickly the envelope adjusts to its 'Sustain' level after its attack is completed.</p>
		<p><strong>C: Sustain</strong><br/>
		This represents the resting level of the envelope whilst the key is depressed.</p>
		<p><strong>D: Release</strong><br/>
		This controls how quickly the level of the envelope returns to zero after the key is released.</p>
		<p>For instance, a short, percussive sound will have a short attack, medium decay and perhaps zero sustain. A more drawn out, bowed sound may have a long attack, high sustain and long decay.</p>
		<h4>2.4 Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO)</h4>
		<p>The LFO is a special type of oscillator which oscillates at a much lower frequency than the tone-generating VCOs. They can be used to repeatedly modulate certain aspects of the sound over time.</p>
		<p><strong>A: Wave</strong><br/>
		Like the VCOs, the waveform of the LFO can be adjusted. Available waveforms for the LFO are sine wave, ramp, saw, square and Sample+Hold (essentially a random frequency generator).</p>
		<p><strong>B: Rate</strong><br/>
		This is the frequency of the LFO, which controls the speed at which the chosen destinations are modulated. By using relatively high rates, entirely new distorted and modulated sounds can be generated.</p>
		<p><strong>C: Amount</strong><br/>
		This controls the overall effect of the LFO. At low settings the effects will be negligible, but at higher settings the effects will be quite extreme.</p>
		<p><strong>D: Destination</strong><br/>
		The destination is the parameter or parameters which will be modulated by the LFO. Options are OSC1+2 (The frequencies of both VCOs), OSC2 (the frequency of oscillator 2 only) or VCF (the filter's cutoff).</p>
		<h3 id="c3">Chapter 3 &mdash; Keyboard and Performance Controls</h3>
		<p>The two-octave onscreen keyboard can be played in exactly the same way as a regular keyboard. It also features extra performance controls whcih add to the expressive range of the synthesizer.</p>
		<h4>3.3 Pitch Wheel</h4>
		<p>This can be used to continuously 'bend' the frequency of the note, either up or down, whilst playing. When released, the pitch wheel will instantly return to its centered, neutral position.</p>
		<h4>3.1 Glide Control</h4>
		<p>Glide (aka Portamento) will cause the synthesizer to move smoothly between notes, rather than jumping immediately in the conventional way. By adjusting the glide control, you can control the speed at which the frequency changes. At its minimum level, there will be no noticeable glide.</p>
		<h4>3.2 Glissando</h4>
		<p>When the Gliss switch is in the off position, the volume and pitch envelopes will restart each time a new note is triggered. When it is turned on, the envelopes will not re-trigger if a second note is played without releasing the first. This enables the synthesizer to move gently between notes without the percussive aspects triggering each time.</p>
		<p><em>Note: The LF1 uses a 'last-note-priority' policy, meaning the base frequency of the oscillators will always correspond to the last note played.</em></p>
		<h3 id="c4">Chapter 4 &mdash; Presets</h3>
		<p>The LF1 features up to 100 user preset slots where your favourite settings can be stored.</p>
		<h4>4.1 Recalling a preset</h4>
		<p>To recall a preset, use the left and right arrow buttons in the presets area to navigate to the required slot, as indicated by the LED display. Slots which have not yet been used will not be available.</p>
		<h4>4.1 Storing a preset</h4>
		<p>To store a preset, enter storage mode by pressing the red button marked Store. Once in storage mode, use the left and right buttons to navigate to the slot in which you want to save the preset. The highest number slot will be a free slot, until all 100 preset slots (zero to 99) have been used. If you are storing to an existing slot, the preset in that slot will be overwritten.</p>
		<h3 id="c5">Chapter 5 &mdash; Settings</h3>
		<p>Touching the wrench icon in the top-right of the app will reveal the settings menu. Here you are presented with the following options:</p>
		<h4>5.1 MIDI Input</h4>
		<p>The LF1 can also be played using an external keyboard or other device. If you have any such devices attached, you can select them here.</p>
		<h4>5.2 Keyboard Shift</h4>
		<p>This can be used to shift the on-screen keyboard up or down by up to 2 octaves.</p>
		<h4>5.3 Pitch Wheel Ranged</h4>
		<p>This adjusts the range, in semitones, of the pitch bend from the pitch wheel at its maximum extents.</p>
		<h4>5.4 User Guide</h4>
		<p>Presents this user guide.</p>
		<h4>5.5 Undo</h4>
		<p>The LF1 also includes an undo feature. This is activated by tapping the icon next to the wrench icon in the top bar, and can be used to reverse previous control changes.</p>
		<p>The undo feature cannot be used to reverse preset changes.</p>
		<h3>Chapter 6 &mdash; Inter-App Audio</h3>
		<p>The LF1 supports Inter-App Audio (IAA), which is a feature available in iOS7+ that enables apps installed on one iOS device to share audio and communicate between one another.</p>
		<p>For instance, you can use Apple's GarageBand DAW app as a host to the LF1, and record the output of the LF1 directly into a GarageBand audio track.</p>
		<p>The LF1 makes itself available to host apps as an instrument or generator. This means that it can share its audio output with a host, and allows itself to be controlled and played through a host.</p>
		<p>For more information on how to use Inter-App Audio, please consult the documentation of your host app.</p>
